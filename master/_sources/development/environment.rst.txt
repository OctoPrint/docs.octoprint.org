Setting up a Development environment
====================================

.. _sec-development-environment-source:

Obtaining, building and running the source
------------------------------------------

This describes the general steps in obtaining, building and running. OS specific instructions can be found
below.

  * Prerequisites:

    * `Python 2.7 <https://python.org>`_ including ``pip``, ``setuptools`` and ``virtualenv``
    * `Python 3.7 <https://python.org>`_ including ``pip``, ``setuptools`` and ``virtualenv``
    * `Git <https://git-scm.com>`_

  * Checkout the OctoPrint sources from their Git repository:

      * ``git clone https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint.git``

  * Enter the checked out source folder: ``cd OctoPrint``
  * Create virtual environments in the checked out source folder for both Python 2 and Python 3 to use for
    installing and running OctoPrint and its dependencies. Creating virtual environments avoids potential versioning
    issues for the dependencies with system wide installed instances:

    * PY2: ``virtualenv --python=python2 venv2``
    * PY3: ``virtualenv --python=python3 venv3``

  * Activate one of the virtual environments:

    * PY2: ``source venv2/bin/activate`` (Linux, macOS) or ``source venv2/Scripts/activate`` (Git Bash under Windows, see below)
    * PY3: ``source venv3/bin/activate`` (Linux, macOS) or ``source venv3/Scripts/activate`` (Git Bash under Windows, see below)

  * Update ``pip`` in the virtual environment:

      * ``pip install --upgrade pip``

  * Install OctoPrint in `"editable" mode <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs>`_,
    including its regular *and* development and plugin development dependencies:

      * ``pip install -e .[develop,plugins]``

When the virtual environment is activated you can then:

  * run the OctoPrint server via ``octoprint serve``
  * run the test suite from the checked out source folder via ``pytest``

To switch the activated virtual environment, simply activate the new environment as described above.

To deactivate the virtual environment and return to the system's default Python: ``deactivate``.

If you also want to be able to build the documentation that resides in the ``docs`` subfolder, you need to activate
the *Python 3* environment and install the docs dependencies as well:

  * ``source venv3/bin/activate`` (Linux, macOS) or ``source venv3/Scripts/activate`` (Git Bash under Windows, see below)
  * ``pip install -e .[develop,plugins,docs]``

You can then build the documentation:

  * ``sphinx-build -b html . _build``

.. _sec-development-environment-source-linux:

Linux
.....

This assumes you'll host your OctoPrint development checkout at ``~/devel/OctoPrint``. If you want to use a different
location, please substitute accordingly.

First make sure you have python 2 and 3 including their header files, pip, setuptools, virtualenv, git and some build requirements
installed:

  * On apt based distributions (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, ...):

    .. code-block:: none

       sudo apt-get install python python-pip python-dev python-setuptools python-virtualenv python3 python3-virtualenv python3-dev git libyaml-dev build-essential

.. todo::

   Using a Linux distribution that doesn't use ``apt``? Please send a
   `Pull Request <https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests>`_ to get the necessary
   steps into this guide!

Then:

.. code-block:: none

   cd ~/devel
   git clone https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint.git
   cd OctoPrint
   virtualenv --python=python2 venv2
   virtualenv --python=python3 venv3
   source ./venv2/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e .[develop,plugins]
   source ./venv3/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e .[develop,plugins,docs]

You can then start OctoPrint via ``octoprint`` after activating one of the two virtual environments.

.. _sec-development-environment-windows:

Windows
.......

This assumes you'll host your OctoPrint development checkout at ``C:\Devel\OctoPrint``. If you want to use a different
location, please substitute accordingly.

First download & install:

  * `Git for Windows <https://git-for-windows.github.io/>`_
  * `Latest *stable* Python 2.7 and Python 3.8 releases from python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_
    (at the time of writing those are ``2.7.18`` and ``3.8.4``)

    * make sure to have the installer add Python to the ``PATH`` and have it install ``pip`` too
    * it's recommended to install Python 2.7 into ``C:\Python27`` and Python 3 into ``C:\Python38`` - if you select
      different install locations please substitute accordingly

  * `Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 <http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>`_
  * `Build Tools For Visual Studio 2019 <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019>`_

    * install "C++ build tools" and ensure the latest versions of "MSVCv142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools" and
      "Windows 10 SDK" are checked.

Open the Git Bash you just installed and in that:

.. code-block:: none

   pip install virtualenv
   cd /c/Devel
   git clone https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint.git
   cd OctoPrint
   virtualenv --python=C:\Python27\python.exe venv2
   virtualenv --python=C:\Python38\python.exe venv3
   source ./venv2/Scripts/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e .[develop,plugins]
   source ./venv3/Scripts/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e .[develop,plugins,docs]

.. _sec-development-environment-mac:

Mac OS X
........

.. note::

   This guide is based on the `Setup Guide for Mac OS X on OctoPrint's forum <https://community.octoprint.org/t/setting-up-octoprint-on-macos/13425>`_.
   Please report back if it works for you, due to lack of access to a Mac I cannot test it myself. Thanks.

.. todo::

   This guide is not yet adapted to the concurrent use of Python 2 and 3 environments during development. Please send a
   `Pull Request <https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests>`_ to get the necessary
   steps into this guide!

This assumes you'll host your OctoPrint development checkout at ``~/devel/OctoPrint``. If you want to use a different
location, please substitute accordingly.

You'll need a user account with administrator privileges.

  * Install the latest version of Xcode suitable for your OS. For example, OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) requires Xcode 7.
  * Install Xcode's command line tools:

    * ``xcode-select --install``
    * ``sudo xcodebuild`` (ensure the license was accepted)
    * If you have more than one Xcode installed: ``sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer``

  * Install Homebrew and use that to install Python:

    * ``ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"``
    * ``brew install python``

  * Install `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/>`_

    * ``pip install virtualenv``

  * Install OctoPrint

    .. code-block:: none

       cd ~/devel
       git clone https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint.git
       cd OctoPrint
       virtualenv venv
       source venv/bin/activate
       pip install --upgrade pip
       pip install -e .[develop,plugins]

.. _sec-development-environment-ides:

IDE Setup
---------

.. todo::

   Using another IDE than the ones below? Please send a
   `Pull Request <https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests>`_ to get the necessary
   steps into this guide!

.. _sec-development-environment-ides-pycharm:

PyCharm
.......

  - "File" > "Open ...", select OctoPrint checkout folder (e.g. ``~/devel/OctoPrint`` or ``C:\Devel\OctoPrint``)
  - Register virtual environments:

    - **(Linux, Windows)** "File" > "Settings ..." > "Project: OctoPrint" > "Project Interpreter" > "Add local ...",
      select OctoPrint ``venv2`` folder (e.g. ``~/devel/OctoPrint/venv2`` or ``C:\Devel\OctoPrint\venv2``).
    - **(macOS)** "PyCharm" > "Preferences ..." > "Project: OctoPrint" > "Project Interpreter" > "Add ..." >
      "Virtualenv Environment > "Existing Environment", select OctoPrint ``venv2`` folder (e.g. ``~/devel/OctoPrint/venv2``).

    Repeat for the ``venv3`` folder.

  - Right click "src" in project tree, mark as source folder
  - Add Run/Debug Configuration, select "Python":

    * Name: OctoPrint server
    * Module name: ``octoprint``
    * Parameters: ``serve --debug``
    * Project: ``OctoPrint``
    * Python interpreter: Project Default
    * Working directory: the OctoPrint checkout folder (e.g. ``~/devel/OctoPrint`` or ``C:\Devel\OctoPrint``)
    * If you want dependencies to auto-update on run if necessary: "Before Launch" > "+" > "Run external tool" > "+"

      * Name: Update OctoPrint dependencies
      * Program: ``$PyInterpreterDirectory$/pip`` (or ``$PyInterpreterDirectory$/pip.exe`` on Windows)
      * Parameters: ``install -e .[develop,plugins]``
      * Working directory: ``$ProjectFileDir$``

      Note that sadly that seems to cause some hiccups on current PyCharm versions due to ``$PyInterpreterDirectory$``
      being empty sometimes, so if this fails to run on your installation, you should update your dependencies manually
      for now.

  - Add Run/Debug Configuration, select "Python tests" and therein "pytest":

    * Name: OctoPrint tests
    * Target: Custom
    * Project: ``OctoPrint``
    * Python interpreter: Project Default
    * Working directory: the OctoPrint checkout folder (e.g. ``~/devel/OctoPrint`` or ``C:\Devel\OctoPrint``)
    * Just like with the run configuration for the server you can also have the dependencies auto-update on run of
      the tests, see above on how to set this up.

  - Add Run/Debug Configuration, select "Python":

    * Name: OctoPrint docs
    * Module name: ``sphinx.cmd.build``
    * Parameters: ``-v -T -E ./docs ./docs/_build -b html``
    * Project: ``OctoPrint``
    * Python interpreter: ``venv3`` environment (the docs build requires Python 3)
    * Working directory: the OctoPrint checkout folder (e.g. ``~/devel/OctoPrint`` or ``C:\Devel\OctoPrint``)
    * Just like with the run configuration for the server you can also have the dependencies auto-update when building
      the documentation, see above on how to set this up.

    Note that this requires you to also have installed the additional ``docs`` dependencies into the Python 3 venv as
    described above via ``pip install -e .[develop,plugins,docs]``.

To switch between Python 2 and 3, all you need to do now is change the Project Default Interpreter and restart
OctoPrint. On current PyCharm versions you can do that right from a small selection field in the footer of the IDE.
Otherwise go through Settings.

.. note::

   Make sure you are running a PyCharm version of 2016.1 or later, or manually fix
   `a debugger bug contained in earlier versions <https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-18365>`_ or plugin management
   will not work in your developer install when running OctoPrint from PyCharm in debug mode.
